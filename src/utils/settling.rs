//! Conditional Settling Utility for Commands
//!
//! Taken from evian.
//!
//! This module provides utilities for determining when a control system (typically a [`Command`])
//! has "settled" at its target state, signaling that the algorithm has successfully reached its goal.
//! While different control algorithms may define "completeness" in varying ways, this module's
//! [`Tolerances`] struct implements the common approach of settling via *tolerances*.
//!
//! # Tolerances
//!
//! *Tolerances* define an acceptable range of values around a target state. This is useful to define,
//! because physical systems will never achieve their exact target due to real-world factors
//! like friction, sensor noise, and mechanical limitations. Under the [`Tolerances`] struct, a system is considered
//! "settled" when it meets specified error and velocity tolerances for a given duration, after when a timeout is
//! reached.

/// A utility for determining when a control system has stabilized reasonably near its setpoint.
///
/// This struct monitors both position error and velocity to determine if a system has
/// reached and stabilized at its target. It can be configured with tolerances for both
/// error and velocity, a required duration to maintain those tolerances, and an optional
/// timeout for if the target isn't reached in a reasonable amount of time.
///
/// # Settling Logic
///
/// A system is considered settled if either:
/// - The specified timeout has elapsed since the first call to [`Tolerances::is_settled`], OR
/// - Both:
///   1. The error and velocity are within their respective tolerances.
///   2. The system has maintained these tolerances for the specified duration.
///
/// If the system leaves the tolerance window before the duration is met, the tolerance timer resets.
